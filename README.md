# Problem Story
You are an engineer in the payment/checkout team at a company called Acme Media Ltd. You are required to build a single page checkout screen where the item id, name, description, price and quantity aree rendered on a single page for checkout via url parameters. The payment options should include momo and card payments. Make all reasonable assumptions the will help you succeed, and be ready to validate those assumptions. Feel free to use any css framework of your choice. This is preferrable. Dummy payment information should come with some basic validations and this should be stored in any data store of your choosing. 

Use the express/typescript framework/technology, add some minimal tests cases and have documentation of how to set it up.
